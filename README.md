## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ElaMCB/ai-prompt-engineering-mastery
cd ai-prompt-engineering-mastery
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook notebooks/01_prompt_foundations.ipynb
```

**Try this first:** Open the first notebook and fix three broken prompts in the opening challenge. You'll see immediate results.

## Learning Path

### Foundation Skills
- **Prompt Foundations** - Craft precise instructions that AI understands
- **Context Mastery** - Ground AI in your specific data and domain
- **Structured Outputs** - Generate JSON, APIs, and clean data formats
- **Chain-of-Thought** - Build AI that reasons step by step

### Engineering Systems
- **Agent Frameworks** - Create AI that uses tools and makes decisions
- **Prompt Chaining** - Design multi-step AI workflows
- **Self-Improvement** - Build systems that critique and refine their own work
- **Testing & Evaluation** - Measure performance and optimize rigorously

### Production Projects
- **Customer Support AI** - Automate support while maintaining quality
- **Content Engine** - Generate and optimize marketing content
- **Code Assistant** - Review, debug, and improve code automatically
- **Research Bot** - Synthesize information from multiple sources

## Hands-On Learning

Every concept includes runnable code you can modify and experiment with immediately. Start with working examples, then fix broken code, then build from scratch.

**Weekly Challenge:** Each Monday we release a new real-world prompt engineering problem. Submit your solution and see how others approach the same task.

## Code Examples

```python
# Fix real prompt issues in the first notebook
def debug_prompt(broken_prompt):
    """Transform vague requests into precise instructions"""
    return professional_prompt

# Build autonomous systems in week 3
class ResearchAgent:
    def answer_question(self, query):
        return verified_answer
```

## Setup

**Requirements:** Python 3.8+, basic programming experience

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ElaMCB/ai-prompt-engineering-mastery
cd ai-prompt-engineering-mastery
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**API Setup** (create .env file):
```text
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

## Community

- **Weekly coding challenges** - Solve real prompt engineering problems
- **Project showcase** - Share what you build and get feedback
- **Community solutions** - Learn from different approaches to the same problem
- **Continuous updates** - New content based on what works in production

## Career Outcomes

Previous learners have used these projects to land roles as prompt engineers, add AI capabilities to products, build AI startups, and accelerate research workflows.

**What you'll build:** Four portfolio-ready projects that demonstrate real business value, not just theoretical concepts.

## Get Started

The first notebook includes three broken prompts waiting for your fixes. Open it and start seeing immediate improvements:

```bash
